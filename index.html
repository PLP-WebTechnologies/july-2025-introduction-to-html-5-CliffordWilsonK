      <h2>Chapter One: The Dreamer</h2>
      <p>In a quiet village nestled between hills, lived a boy named Eli. Every night, he would sit beneath the stars and whisper his dreams to the sky. While others laughed at his hope, Eli believed one day the stars would answer.</p>

      <h2>Chapter Two: The Fall</h2>
      <p>One fateful evening, a star fell from the sky and landed in the nearby woods. Eli ran into the darkness, heart pounding with wonder. But when he reached the glowing crater, all he found was a small, dim crystal—cold and silent.</p>
      <p>Disappointed, he returned home. People mocked him. “Chasing stars?” they scoffed. He began to doubt himself. But deep inside, something told him it wasn’t over.</p>

      <h2>Chapter Three: The Rise</h2>
      <p>Days passed, and the crystal began to glow whenever Eli spoke his dreams aloud. Slowly, it grew brighter. Word spread. The same people who mocked him now gathered to listen as Eli shared stories of hope and wonder.</p>
      <p>Eventually, that dull crystal shone like the sun—becoming a beacon for dreamers across the land. Eli had found his star, not in the sky, but within himself.</p>

      <h2>The Moral of the Story</h2>
      <p>Sometimes, the answers we seek aren’t flashy or immediate. But if you hold onto your dreams—even when they seem dim—they’ll guide you, grow with you, and light the way for others too.</p>
